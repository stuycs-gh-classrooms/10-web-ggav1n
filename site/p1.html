  <b>The Order Station:</b> When you open up your business for the day, customers will regularly arrive to order pizzas. They will order pizzas with directions on how they want it made: toppings, how much time it should be baked, and how it's cut. The game will automatically take their order when you click on the waiting customer.
 This is also where customers will rate your performance at all stations, and will leave tips accordingly. Thus, as you're preparing their order, don't forget to come back to the order station to see if there are any waiting customers, or else impatient customers will lose you precious points!
 You can customize this station with decorations earned with money/points, and customers will interact with these decorations as they wait for their order to be finished.

  <b>The Topping Station:</b> After receiving orders, head over to the topping station to place toppings on a pre-made pie! Drag and drop toppings on specific areas of the pizza to create an outstanding pizza! You start off with pepporoni as the only topping, but as you advance to Day 2, you can unlock the following toppings:
</p>
  <ul>
   <li class="i">Anchovies</li>
   <li class="i">Onions</li>
   <li class="i">Mushrooms</li>
   <li class="i">Peppers</li>
   <li class="i">Sausages</li>
  </ul>

  <b>The Baking Station:</b> Each customer wants their pizza prepared to a different amount of freshness. After finishing with toppings, send your pizza to the oven for cooking. Customers will choose to have their pizzas cooked to different points on the timer dial. When the pizza is finished baking, the player clicks on it to move it to the next station. Time yourself, and take the pie out when it reaches the timer mark as indicated on the customer's order!

<p>
  <b>The Cutting Station:</b> Slice the pizza into even slices, as indicated by the order, then send the steaming, fresh pizza out to the waiting customer! Each customer will order their pizzas sliced into four, six, or eight pieces. To slice pizzas, the player must drag across the pizza. If the incorrect number of pieces are cut, or if some slices are disproportionate, points will be deducted upon presenting the pizza to the customer.

  <b>Customers:</b> Customers are a valuable component to your business. Be sure to get their order as precise and quick as possible for them to leave a good rating and tip! If you do so, customers will become regulars and you will be able to unlock new customers that may tip more or may demand a more complicated pizza!
