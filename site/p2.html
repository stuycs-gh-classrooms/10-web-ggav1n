  The Order Station
 </div>
  This is the area where customers will show up and order their sushis and bobas. By clicking on the waiting customers, you will take note of the different assortments they want on their sushi and boba orders. Later, when you finish their order, you will return to the order station where customers will leave ratings and tips. <br>
   <p class="italics">
    Make sure to check this station regularly, as customers will come in while you are preparing orders! Having them wait too long will result in lower ratings and tips; hone in on your management skills under pressure in order to run a highly successful sushi restaurant.

  The Cook Station
 </div>
  At this station, you will cook the sushi rice. First,put rice into one of the Sushi Squares, and then pour Sushi Vinegar into it once the cooking meter reaches the green arrow. Once the cooking meter reaches the yellow arrow, the rice is finished. Then, pick up the Sushi Square and place it on top of the rolled out sushi seaweed wrap on the right. The Sushi Square will then roll across the sushi wrap, spreading out a layer of rice. You can then move on to the next station. There are a variety of rice and wraps available to be used. For rice, there is brown rice, white rice, shiso rice, and black rice. For wraps, nori, momoiro soy paper, and ukoniro soy paper are always avaiable and there are seasonal wraps such as the tortilla and manicotti.

  The Build Station
 </div>
  In this station, you will first add fillings evenly across the nori paper, add toppings and sauces to the sushi, and then cut the sushi evenly. Fillings include crab stick, salmon, tuna, fried calamari, and wagyu. Placeable toppings include prawn, avocado, and mango slices. Shakers include bonito flakes, tempura crunch, and furikake. Sauces include duck sauce, sriracha, and ponzu. There are also a variety of seasonal ingredients to choose from. <br>
   <p class="italics">
    This is the station which customers will be most judgemental on. Make sure to distribute the fillings, toppings, and sauces evenly to create a cookie-cutter sushi with higher ratings from the customer.

  The Tea Station
 </div>
  Here, you will make bubble tea to be served along with the sushi. Tea flavors include matcha tea, chai, and taro tea. Tea bubbles include mango bubbles, tapioca pearls, and lychee bubbles. Seasonal ingredients may also appear, and these ingredients include hakuto tea and witch's brew tea. To make the bubble tea, complete calibrations to ensure the right amount of tea and tea bubbles. <br>
 <p class="italics">
  Be patient on the calibrations! Try to score as close and accurate as possible to the middle star to obtain the highest ratings for this station.

  <b>Customers:</b> Customers are a valuable component to your business. Be sure to get their order as precise and quick as possible for them to leave a good rating and tip! If you do so, customers will become regulars and you will be able to unlock new customers that may tip more! Some customers are labelled as "Closers" or "Food Critics." "Closers" come at the end of the day with a challenging order, and "Food critics" never order the same order twice!
