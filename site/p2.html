  <b>Customers:</b> Customers are a valuable component to your business. Be sure to get their order as precise and quick as possible for them to leave a good rating and tip! If you do so, customers will become regulars and you will be able to unlock new customers that may tip more! Some customers are labelled as "Closers" or "Food Critics." "Closers" come at the end of the day with a challenging order, and "Food critics" never order the same order twice!
